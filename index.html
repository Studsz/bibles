            anger: "James 1:19-20: My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.",
            envy: "Proverbs 14:30: A heart at peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones.",
            lust: "Matthew 5:28: But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.",
